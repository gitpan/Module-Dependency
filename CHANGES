Fixed minor typoes and niggling things that should have been corrected 
in the distribution - thanks to Mike Castle & Ron Savage

Indexer.pm converts paths to absolute paths before running File::Find,
giving the correct, expected, behaviour when you try to index relative
folders

Added support for the 'base' pragma.

Added the 'relationship' method (and hence the -r option to dumper.plx)
which tells you how two items are related.

Improved POD-skipping algorithm - i.e. it now has one.

There should be no platform-specific code left, and in theory this will
run on any OS.

Added a little POD-only module called Module::Dependency.

We 'use' as little as possible and 'require' the rest.

The indexer can optionally (and does, by default) look at a file's #! line
to see if it's a perl program. .pl, .plx and .pm files are always indexed.

Added accessor routine for the 'check_shebang' switch.

cgidepend.plx, the CGI program, slightly tweaked to be even more
mod_perl friendly.

Some code and ideas kindly contributed by S Rezic, S Heffner and C Sampson,
among others.

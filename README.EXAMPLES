Module::Dependency Documentation
------------------ -------------

Examples
--------

You should find some examples of what the Grapher module can do in the
root of this distribution. All examples were generated from the test
files in the t/u/ directory using the grapher.plx program.

Images
------

Five GIFs have been created to show you the different sorts of charts
you can get. Have a look at example*.gif in this directory. Note that your
local copy of GD may not create GIFs - it will probably create PNGs.
Created using the Module::Dependency::Grapher::makeImage routine.

The images are also inlined in example.html so you might find it easiest to
just open that file.

PostScript
----------

If you have the PostScript::Simple module then you can output in PostScript
or EPS format. See example.ps and example.eps - I personally find EPS a more
useful format.

Plain Text
----- ----

The file example.txt contains text versions of the example images.
Created using the Module::Dependency::Grapher::makeText routine.

HTML
----

The file example.html contains HTML fragment versions of the example
images. It being HTML, we have the images inline followed by their
HTML equivalents. The visual styling is done with CSS so that there is
no hard-coded BGCOLOR or similar attributes. See example.css for the
classes used, or view the HTML source.

SVG
---

If you have the SVG.pm module you can create images in SVG format too.
Files example1.svg, example2.svg and example3.svg are SVG versions of the
images example[123].gif mentioned above. You may render these images in
a number of ways, although most people will find installing an SVG
plug-in for their web browser easiest. I personally use the Adobe plug-in.

CGI
---

An example installation of the CGI is at:

But note that this machine is not hugely powerful so it may take a
few seconds to build the image. Your hardware will probably be 
quicker. For various reasons this may not be running the latest
software.
